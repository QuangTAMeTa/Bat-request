2. Run [frida-server](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases) on your device using adb.
3. Run Instagram on Your Phone or Emulator
4. Put Below Code in a File Name `script.js` and Run Using Python (`python script.py`):
```python
import frida, sys

def on_message(message, data):
    print(message)

process = frida.get_usb_device().attach('com.instagram.android')

jscode = """
Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("libscrambler.so", "_ZN9Scrambler9getStringESs"), {
    onLeave: function (retval) {
        console.log(Memory.readCString(retval));
    }
});
"""

script = process.create_script(jscode)
script.on('message', on_message)
print('[*] Running sniffer')
script.load()
sys.stdin.read()
```
